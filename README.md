# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **customer shopping behavior** using transactional data from **3,900 purchases** across multiple product categories.  
The goal is to uncover actionable insights related to:

- Customer spending patterns  
- Product performance  
- Discount and subscription behavior  
- Customer segmentation  
- Revenue drivers  

The project combines **Python (ETL & cleaning)**, **MySQL (EDA)**, and **Power BI (dashboarding)** to simulate a real-world end-to-end data analytics workflow (Cleaning → Analysis → Business Insights → Dashboard).

## 🐍 Explore Transform and Load (Python)

ETL and data preparation were performed using **Python (Pandas & NumPy)**.\
Checkout the complete [Python Script](Data_ETL.ipynb) for more detailed steps.

### Overview of Steps Performed

#### 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
- Imported the dataset using `pandas`.
- Checked structure with `df.info()`.
- Identified missing values using `df.isna().sum()`.
- Generated statistical summaries using `df.describe()`.

#### 2. Column Standardization
- Converted all column names to **snake_case**.
- Improved consistency and SQL compatibility.

#### 3. Handling Missing Values
- Imputed missing values in `review_rating`.
- Used **median rating within each product category** to keep the imputation of nulls more realistic.

#### 6. Data Type Optimization

- Standardized column data types to improve **consistency, memory efficiency, and query performance**.
- Reduced dataset size from **~548 KB to ~207 KB**, improving storage efficiency and downstream SQL performance.

#### 5. Data Consistency Checks
- Identified duplicate information between:
  - `discount_applied`
  - `promo_code_used`
- Dropped `promo_code_used` to avoid redundancy.

#### 6. Feature Engineering
- Created `age_group` by binning customer ages.
- Derived `purchase_frequency_days` by mapping the purchase frequency column.

#### 7. Database Integration
- Exported the cleaned DataFrame to **MySQL**.
- Enabled structured, scalable SQL analysis.
